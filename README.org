* Description
This is a script to autopackup the Appimage file.
I make this, because I can run the source appimage in the Fedora.
And I don't know how to solve it.

* How to use

1. Make it executable.
   #+begin_src shell
chmod +x packUpAppimage.sh
   #+end_src
2. Pass an absolute path as a parameter. For example:
   #+begin_src shell
./packUpAppimage.sh ~/Download/example.appimage
   #+end_src
3. Find it in the =~/Applications=

* Others
This is only for the system which is x86_64. If you want to run this on your computer.
Please add the correspond appimagetools file in =appimagetools=.

You can find the tool file [[https://github.com/AppImage/appimagetool][here]].
